## Problem Statement:
Many students struggle to maintain a consistent study routine, often forgetting to review previously learned material. As a result, they may fail to retain important information and perform poorly in exams. There is a need for a simple tool that helps students track their study progress and reminds them to review topics at appropriate intervals.

## Solution Statement:
To address this problem, we propose the development of a Study Review CLI tool. This tool allows students to add new studies, track their review progress, and receive reminders when it's time to review specific topics. The Study Review CLI tool will store information about each study, including the number of times it has been reviewed and the last review date. Users can easily update study details and view a list of studies that need review.

## MVP/Application Features:
Add New Study: Users can add a new study topic to the system, specifying its name and initial review date.
Show Review Items: The tool displays a list of study topics that need review based on their last review date and review interval.
Update Review Item: Users can update the review status of a study topic, incrementing the review count and updating the last review date.
Show All: Users can view a summary of all study topics, including their review status and upcoming review dates.
Exit: Allows users to exit the Study Review CLI tool.
This Study Review CLI tool aims to improve study habits and knowledge retention by providing students with a convenient way to track their study progress and review schedule.
